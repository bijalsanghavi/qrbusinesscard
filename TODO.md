# TODOs

- Add Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3 for CDN-backed image hosting (presigned PUT, custom domain).
- Integrate Stripe billing (7-day trial), subscription checks on hosted profiles.
- Add Alembic migrations and production DB setup guides.
- Implement QR preview (SVG/PNG), density meter, and print guidance.
- Add validation and masking for phone/email inputs on the frontend.
- Extend profile management (list, edit, delete) with auth.
- Harden security: rate limiting, input size caps across endpoints.
- E2E test matrix across iOS/Android scanners; vCard compatibility checks.
